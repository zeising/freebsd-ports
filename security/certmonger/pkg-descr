The certmonger daemon monitors certificates for impending expiration, and can
optionally refresh soon-to-be-expired certificates with the help of a CA. If
told to, it can drive the entire enrollment process from key generation through
enrollment and refresh.

It can work with either flat files, like those used by OpenSSL, or with NSS
databases.
